The Sleep Buddies webapp

Project for Team 17, UC San Diego CSE 110 Fall 2024

## Introduction

College students often have difficulty falling and getting good quality sleep. Our app allows our users to monitor 
their sleep schedule with weekly reports based on their sleep patterns. Additionally, the app also includes a white noise and meditation feature
to help users relax and unwind before bedtime. To further support students, the app includes an alarm feature to remind them to maintain a consistent sleep routine. By addressing these challenges, this app aims to reduce the stress college students face because of lack of sleep / poor 
sleep.

## Requirements

This project uses React in Typescript, and requires `Node.js` and `npm`

To install **Node.js** and **npm** on your system, follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

### Installing npm on macOS:

   ```

2. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install Node.js (npm is bundled with Node.js):
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, verify that both Node.js and npm were installed successfully by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Installing npm on Windows:
1. **Download Node.js:**
   Go to the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version of Node.js for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions in the setup wizard. Ensure that the option to install npm is selected during installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, open a command prompt and verify that both Node.js and npm were installed successfully by running:
